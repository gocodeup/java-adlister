- Need to fix convert user ID to username

- Get search to work

- Show users ads on their profile page

- Dynamic navbar: show different links if user is logged in (toggle create ads link, add link to view all ads)

- Add buttons to allow users to update and delete ads

- Allow users to update their profile information



- validate data that goes to database
- Display error messages (passwords don't match, try to create a ad without title)

Sticky forms?

- Categories table?
